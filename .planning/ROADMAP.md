# Roadmap: AI Avatar Platform (BeiGene)

## Overview

This roadmap delivers the AI Avatar Platform in 6 phases: foundation and architecture first, then F2F text coaching (the core value loop), scoring & assessment enhancements, dashboards & reporting, training material management, and conference presentation module. Each phase builds on the previous one and delivers a coherent, demonstrable capability. Architecture-first principle applies throughout -- pluggable adapters, config-driven features, and shared components are established in Phase 01 and extended by every subsequent phase.

## Phases

  2. Token broker returns all per-HCP voice/avatar settings when hcp_profile_id is provided, falls back to global defaults when not
  3. New HCPs get smart defaults (voice "Ava", avatar "Lori-casual", temp 0.9, Server VAD) without manual configuration
  4. MR does NOT see a mode picker -- system auto-selects best mode based on HCP config and service availability
  5. Fallback chain works: Digital Human Realtime Agent -> Voice-only Realtime -> Text, with toast notification and persistent mode status indicator
  6. HCP table shows Voice & Avatar column with badge pair showing per-HCP configuration
  7. Agent instructions support admin override via Agent tab (D-02)

- [x] 27-07-PLAN.md -- Create New Prompt: POST /prompts + list-page create dialog (was Phase 28 Plan 01)
- [x] 27-08-PLAN.md -- View historical version content: read-only version content viewer (was Phase 28 Plan 02)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every one of the 9 project prompts is registered, versioned, and admin-editable from a single UI
  2. Admin can AI-optimize any prompt, compare original vs optimized, and adopt it as a new version
  3. Every optimization is recorded as a run (original, result, mode, model, time) and version history supports rollback
  4. Migrating builders to the registry causes zero output change with default (seeded) content
  5. The prompt-optimizer runs as an internal-only service backed by Azure OpenAI with secrets from Key Vault
  6. Admin can create a brand-new prompt from the list UI (not limited to optimizing existing ones) and view the text content of any historical version

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 28: 需要上传资料转成sop的skill，就需要注册到ai foundary里面去。在培训过程中，就是把skill给hcp和用户进行对话。

**Goal:** Register upload-material-derived SOP Skills (Phase 19 output) as first-class Azure AI Foundry entities on publish, and mount them into the HCP agent's toolbox at training-session time so the agent can consume skill content in dialog with the trainee -- across both text chat and Voice Live, with non-blocking failure degradation at every step.
**Requirements**: D-01, D-02, D-03, D-04, D-05, D-06, D-07
**Depends on:** Phase 19, Phase 24
**Plans:** 4/4 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 28-01-PLAN.md -- Foundry skill registration: Skill model sync columns + migration, Entra-ID-only skill_foundry_service.py, wired into publish/archive/delete lifecycle hooks (D-01, D-03, D-06)
- [x] 28-02-PLAN.md -- Session-time skill consumption abstraction: Toolbox mount + MCP probe + download fallback + local-degrade chain, wired into session_service.py for both text and Voice Live via focus_instruction (D-02, D-04, D-05, D-06)
- [x] 28-03-PLAN.md -- Foundry sync status API + admin UI: schema/routes for manual retry and portal-url discovery, SkillFoundryStatusSection component mirroring the HCP agent sync UI, wired into the Skill editor (D-06, D-07)
- [x] 28-04-PLAN.md -- Playwright E2E coverage for the Foundry sync admin story: status section rendering, retry flow, portal link, degradation states (D-06, D-07)

### Phase 29: Voice Live API Refactor & Adaptation — 升级 azure-ai-voicelive SDK 至 1.3.0（GA api-version 2026-07-15），正式化双路径交互架构（文本直连 Agent Responses API，语音走 Voice Live → Agent），删除 voice-agent monkey-patch 与 classic agent 旧路径，VoiceLiveInstance 变为可选，移除 HCP 内联 voice/avatar deprecated 字段，拆分 Agent Foundation Model 与 Voice Live 模型目录，更新 docs/voice-live-avatar 文档套件与全部相关测试

**Goal:** Upgrade azure-ai-voicelive SDK to 1.3.0 GA (api-version 2026-07-15), formalize the dual-path architecture (text via Agent Responses API, voice via Voice Live → hosted Agent), delete the voice-agent monkey-patch and classic-agent path, make VL Instance mandatory per HCP (D-10 supersedes the roadmap's "optional" wording), remove the 14 deprecated inline HCP voice/avatar fields, split the Agent Foundation Model catalog from the Voice Live model catalog, and fully update docs + tests.
**Requirements**: D-01..D-16 (from 29-CONTEXT.md)
**Depends on:** Phase 28
**Plans:** 10/10 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 29-01-PLAN.md -- SDK 1.3.0 GA installability POC + Entra/API-key Agent connect + Foundry capabilities probe (D-03, D-04, D-14-probe)
- [x] 29-02-PLAN.md -- Single GA api-version setting + tested resync_classic_agent() foundation (D-02, D-05)
- [x] 29-03-PLAN.md -- WS proxy core rewire: Entra-first credentials, GA api-version, classic-branch/monkey-patch deletion, forced agent mode (D-01, D-02, D-05, D-06, D-07, D-08)
- [x] 29-04-PLAN.md -- WebRTC signaling path mirror of the WS rewiring (D-02, D-05, D-07, D-08)
- [x] 29-05-PLAN.md -- Drop 14 deprecated HcpProfile columns + VL-required API validation (D-09, D-13)
- [x] 29-06-PLAN.md -- resolve_voice_config() safe-defaults fallback + dead denormalized-cache write-site removal (D-12)
- [x] 29-07-PLAN.md -- Frontend: VL-required save validation + read-only Voice/Avatar VL summary card + inline-field cleanup (D-10, D-11)
- [x] 29-08-PLAN.md -- Agent Foundation Model catalog: Foundry deployments endpoint + HCP editor dropdown (D-14)
- [x] 29-09-PLAN.md -- Merge docs/voice-live-avatar into one 17-file tree with dual-path architecture diagram (D-15)
- [x] 29-10-PLAN.md -- Cross-cutting verification sweep: full backend/frontend suites + actual Playwright E2E + coverage gate + stale-literal sweep (D-16)

### Phase 30: Scenario API D-10 VoiceLiveInstance Propagation Fix — 修复 scenario.py 未迁移到 Phase 29 嵌套结构导致的 voice/avatar 模式门控断裂

**Goal:** Propagate the Phase 29 D-10 column drop to the scenario API — replace `HcpProfileSummary` (backend/app/schemas/scenario.py:55-67) hardcoded flat defaults (avatar_character, avatar_style, voice_live_enabled, avatar_enabled) with nested `voice_live_instance: VoiceLiveInstanceSummary | None`, remove the stray flat `avatar_enabled` from frontend/src/types/hcp.ts, and re-verify the three consumers (training.tsx, unified-session.tsx, scenario-group-run.tsx) so scenario-driven voice/digital-human training modes are offered again and avatar character/style resolve correctly.
**Requirements**: D-10 propagation (v1.0 audit integration gap, critical)
**Gap Closure:** Closes integration gap "scenario API → frontend voice/avatar mode gating" + restores flow F2 "voice+avatar session with fallback" (v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md 2026-07-20)
**Depends on:** Phase 29

**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 30-01-PLAN.md -- Backend: nested voice_live_instance in HcpProfileBrief/ScenarioOut (api/scenarios.py), sync dead schema, rewrite backend avatar-field tests (TDD)
- [x] 30-02-PLAN.md -- Frontend: HcpProfileSummary type contract, narrow Scenario.hcp_profile, delete stray avatar_enabled from HcpProfile
- [x] 30-03-PLAN.md -- Frontend: fix avatar-gating reads in training.tsx + scenario-group-run.tsx, add first-ever gating test coverage for scenario-group-run
- [x] 30-04-PLAN.md -- Frontend: repair 5 stale hcp_profile test fixtures (training/scenario-card/scenario-panel/scenario-table/unified-session)
- [x] 30-05-PLAN.md -- E2E: fix stale training-start-session.spec.ts assertions, add gating-restoration test, full verification pass, human checkpoint

### Phase 31: Training Material Retention Auto-Deletion — 实现素材保留期自动删除（Phase 05 遗留功能缺口）

**Goal:** Implement automatic deletion of expired training materials — add a `delete_expired_materials` service consuming the existing `material_retention_days` config (backend/app/config.py:79), wire it into scheduled enforcement (app lifespan / periodic task), and cover it with unit tests. Closes the Phase 05 verification gap where retention config exists but nothing consumes it.
**Requirements**: Phase 05 goal "voice records respect retention policies" (v1.0 audit phase-verification gap, critical)
**Gap Closure:** Closes Phase 05 gaps_found item "Retention auto-deletion never implemented" (v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md 2026-07-20)
**Depends on:** Phase 05

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd-plan-phase 31 to break down)
